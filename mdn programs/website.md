# MDN Important Points for Wesite Development

1. Use gulp to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests.
2. Setup local testing server, see Express Web Framework (Node.js/JavaScript).
3. A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure on your local computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking right, before you eventually upload them to a server.
4. Name folders and files completely in lowercase with no spaces. 
5. Tt is best to get into the habit of writing your folder and file names lowercase with no spaces and with words separated by dashes. It's better to separate words with dashes, rather than underscores: my-file.html vs. my_file.html. The short answer is that you should use a hyphen for your file names. The Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator, but does not treat an underscore that way
6. Publishing you website via GitHub
    Now let's take you through how to easily publish your site via GitHub Pages.

    First of all, sign up for GitHub and verify your email address.
    Next, you need to create a repository for your files to go in.
    On this page, in the Repository name box, enter username.github.io, where username is your username. So for example, our friend bobsmith would enter bobsmith.github.io.
    Also check Initialize this repository with a README and then click Create repository.
    After that, drag and drop the content of your website folder into your repository and then click Commit changes.

    Note: Make sure your folder has an index.html file.

    Now navigate your browser to username.github.io to see your website online. For example, for the username chrisdavidmills, go to chrisdavidmills.github.io.

    Note: It may take a few minutes for your website to go live. If it doesn't work immediately, you may have to wait a few minutes and then try again.
